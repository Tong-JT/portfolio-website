            <p>A home inventory management and labelling system utilising a QR code reader and generator to identify items and an interface to group recorded items. The frontend was built with Svelte and the backend was built with .NET, storing data via PostgreSQL.</p>
            <p>This project was an idea for a commercial product, consisting of an inventory management web app that allows users to create and group products, and a corresponding QR code labelling system. Users can generate their own QR codes from notes they created within the web app, or assign notes to existing QR codes.</p>
            <p>The idea arose when I realised the need to provide 'alternative text' to existing labels, such as translations or annotations to prescription labels. This later developed into a general use labelling system for all household items.</p>
