            <p>'Happy Mrs Chicken' is an idle click game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of a class exercise. I incorporated responsive design to ensure it works on both desktop and mobile platforms.</p>
            <p>This game is inspired by Cookie Clicker and was designed to challenge myself to create a dynamic and responsive product with multiple concurrent logic (increment and spending of eggs through manual and automated features) only utilising basic web development skills.</p>
