            <p>This project was developed with Java, utilising JavaFX for the user interface. </p>
            <p>It utlises WebSockets for real-time communication, allowing for users to create and enter chatrooms. Multiple instances of the client can communicate between each other as long as they are connected to the same IP address. It allows users to choose between Caesar cipher and AES encryption options, and adds an extra layer of security with RSA asymmetric encryption between client and server. Users can then export these keys to be used in future sessions.</p>
